## 📌 Overview

**LawQ** is an AI-powered legal document assistant designed to help users understand and query legal contracts using natural language.  
The system processes uploaded legal documents, converts them into semantic embeddings, and retrieves accurate, clause-level answers using modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project demonstrates practical applications of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **AI-driven document analysis** in the legal domain.
